# FocusHub
**AI-Driven Personalized Cognitive Learning and Engagement Platform.**

## Overview
FocusHub is an AI-driven personalized cognitive learning and engagement platform designed to transform digital learning into a productive , focused and addictive (in a positive way) experience.
Unlike traditional learning platforms that only deliver content , here FocusHub analyzes learning behaviour , focus patterns , memory decay and engagement signals to build a smart study companion.

## Core Vision
Redirect social media-style dopamine addiction into meaningful learning habits using AI , ML and cognitive psychology.

## Key highlights
- No camera focus tracking
- Memory decay prediction & smart revision
- AI Study Twin & LLM-based tutor
- Gamified learning streaks
- Secure & cross-device learning

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML , CSS , JavaScript (React later)
- **Backend & Database** (implemented later)
- **Machine Learning** : Scikit-Learn , Pandas , NumPy

## Status of the project
Project initiated.
System design , documentation and core logic in progress.

## Problem Statement
Students today spend excessive time on social media due to addictive recommendation algorithms.
This leads to poor focus , weak memory retention and ineffective learning habits.
**Existing education platforms focus mainly on content delivery and do not adequately address focus loss , cognitive overload , memory decay or learning behaviour.**
FocusHub aims to redirect this addictive behaviour into a productive , learning-focused system
using AI and ML.

## Project Objectives
- Build a focused and distraction-free learning platform.
- Analyze learning behaviour using Machine Learning.
- Predict memory decay and schedule smart revision.
- Improve long-term knowledge retention.
- Create positive learning addiction through gamification.
- Enable secure and continuous learning across devices.

## Core Modules
- Focus & Behaviour Analysis Engine.
- Memory Dexay Prediction & Revision Engine.
- Adaptive Quiz & Difficulty Engine.
- AI Study Twin & Tutor (planned).
- Gamification & Learning Streak System.
- Security & Suspicious Login Detection.

## Development Roadmap
- Phase 1: Project planning & system design (currently working on this).
- Phase 2 : Dataset creation & preprocessing.
- Phase 3 : Core ML model implementation.
- Phase 4 : Frontend integration.
- Phase 5 : Testing & Optimization.

## Project Type
FocusHub is a **web-based learning platform** supported by Machine Learning models to provide personalized study guidance , focus analysis and intelligent recommendations.


## Algorithms Used
1. Logistic Regression - Focus Classification
2. Linear Regression - Memory Prediction
3. Collaborative Filtering - Recommendation System
