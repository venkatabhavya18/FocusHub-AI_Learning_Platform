# FocusHub
FocusHub is an AI-driven personalized cognitive learning and engagement platform designed to transform digital learning into a productive, focused and addictive (in a positive way) experience.
Unlike traditional learning platforms that only deliver content, here FocusHub analyzes learning behaviour, focus patterns, memory decay and engagement signals to build a smart study companion.

# Core Vision
Redirect social media-style dopamine addiction into meaningful learning habits using AI, ML and cognitive psychology.

# Key highlights

- Memory decay prediction & smart revision
- AI Study Twin & LLM-based tutor
- Gamified learning streaks
- Secure & cross-device learning

# Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React later)
- Backend & Database (implemented later)
- ML : Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy

# Status of the project
Project initiated - system design and core logic in progress.
