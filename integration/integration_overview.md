FocusHub integrates a web-based learning interface with machine learning models that analyze learner behavior.
User interactions such as video engagement, quiz performances and focus interruptions are collected at the frontend level and mapped to ML models for focus analysis, memory decay prediction and personalized recommendations.
Since backend services are out of scope in the current phase, the integration is demonstrated using logical mappings and simulated ML outputs.
