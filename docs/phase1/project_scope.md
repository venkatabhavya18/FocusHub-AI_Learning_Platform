- Memory Decay Predictor (basic regression model).
- Spaced Revision Planner.
- Adaptive Quiz Difficulty.
### 2.Focus & Behavior Tracking
- Focus Score based on time , inactivity , tab switching.
- Study streak system.
- Cognitive Load Indicator (light/medium/high).
### 3.AI Assistance
- AI Study Twin (rule + ML based simulation).
- LLM-based Tutor for doubt explanation (text-based).
- Learn-by-Teaching interaction (student explains , system detects gaps).
### Gamification
- XP points.
- Levels and badges.
- Daily learning goals.

## Out of scope (planned for future)
- Full mobile app.
- Real-time video streaming.
- Large-scale deployment.
- Advanced deep learning models.
- Paid creator ecosystem.

## Deliverables
