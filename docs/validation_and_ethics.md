# FocusHub - Validation , Limitations & Ethics.
This document outlines how FocusHub models are validated , along with system limitations and ethical considerations.

## 1. Model Validation Strategy.

### Train-Test split
- Data is split into training and testing sets.
- Typical ratio : 80% training, 20% testing.

### Cross-Validation
- K-Fold cross-validation used for stability.
- Ensures models generalize well to unseen data.

### Perfromance Monitoring
- Periodic evaluation of model accuracy.
- Comparision with baseline models.

## 2. System Limitations.
- Models depend on quality of user interaction data.
- Cold-start problem for new users.
- Focus detection is indirect (no biometric tracking).
- Prototype uses limited datasets.

## 3. Ethical Considerations.
- No camera , microphone or biometric data collection.
- FocusHub avoids addictive dark patterns.
- Gamification is designed for positive reinforcement.
- Transparent model decisions and explainable outputs.

## 4. Privacy and Data Security.
- User data is anonymized.
- Secure data storage practices.
- User control over data visibility.
- Compliance with basic data protection principles.

## Conclusion.
FocusHub aims to provide responsible and ethical AI-driven learning while acknowledging technical and data-related limitations.
