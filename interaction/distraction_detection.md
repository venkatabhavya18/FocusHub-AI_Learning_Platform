# Distraction Detection - FocusHub
FocusHub detects learning interruptions using frontend signals.

## Distraction Indicators
- Browser tab switching
- Page visibility loss
- Long inactivity during video playback

## Interpretation
- Frequent focus loss indicates reduced attention
- Data contributes to focus score calculation

## Acedemic Note
Due to the absence of browser extensions and backend services, distraction detection is implemented at a simulated level, suitable for academic evaluation.

This avoids privacy invasion while enabling focus analysis.
